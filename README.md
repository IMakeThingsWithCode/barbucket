A utility for catching thoughts before they skitter away

I commonly find myself thinking of clever and nonsenical one-liners and I wanted a way to store them, so I decided to make a program that could be opened quickly whenever I got one of these thoughts. I want to keep it simple and adaptable, and just dump all thoughts into a text file.
